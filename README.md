This Kaggle competition involves training a model to predict if someone on the titanic will survive or not. My code can be seen in this repository. 
I do a little data cleaning and manipulation before fitting a random forest classifier. I split my data for training and validation to find a good number of estimators and max depth
for my final random forest classifier model. I then fit my final model on all my training data and make predictions on the provided testing data. I then submit my predictions into the competition.
