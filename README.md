This Kaggle competition involves training a model to predict if someone on the titanic will survive or not. My code can be seen in this repository. 
In this project I engineer new features and look at the mutual information and correlation to determine which feature are effective. I then create a preprocessor 
pipeline for imputing and encoding te numeric and categorical features. I then created a Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier and validate 
the models using k-fold cross validation. Finally I train all my training data on my Gradient Boosting Classifier and submit predictions for the Titanic 
Machine Learning competition on Kaggle which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic.
